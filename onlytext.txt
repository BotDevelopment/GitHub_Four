COPPA

If you have users under the age of thirteen, you may need to comply with COPPA. You only need to enable COPPA if you need to comply and you're using anonymous identities.

You can enable COPPA in the Support SDK by calling the following code. When you enable COPPA, the Support SDK removes the name and email from the end user's identity.
